Documentation
-------------

Run `doxygen` in the `doxygen/` directory, then `make install` in the `sphinx/` directory.

The most up to date documentation is generated from the `sphinx` directory.

The directory `guide` is only here to ensure backward compatibility of potential external documentation links.
